# Replace Logo With New Upload

## What
Copy `Untitled_design_10.png` to both `src/assets/ottoyard-logo.png` and `public/ottoyard-logo-new.png`, replacing the current logo files. No CSS changes needed -- the image will display exactly as uploaded.

## Files Changed
- **`src/assets/ottoyard-logo.png`** -- overwrite with new upload
- **`public/ottoyard-logo-new.png`** -- overwrite with new upload

## Note
This image still has white pixels (not transparency) in the background and hexagon center. On the dark UI, those areas will appear as white squares/regions. If that's not acceptable, the fix is to export from Canva with "Transparent background" enabled (available on Canva Pro), which produces a PNG with true alpha transparency.
