          prompt: |
            You are operating on the OTTOYARD repo.
            If the event is an Issue labeled "claude:implement", IMPLEMENT the Issue.
            Create a new branch, commit changes, and OPEN A PULL REQUEST against main.
            Title the PR based on the Issue title and include a short rationale.
            If the event is an @claude Issue/PR comment asking for implementation,
            do the same: create a branch, commit, and open/update a PR.

            IMPORTANT:
            - Follow CLAUDE.md quality gates (strict TS, tests, docs).
            - Do NOT leave results only in logs; produce a PR.
